# POKEMON BATTLE #

## OVERVIEW ##

  * In this project, I wanted to make a Pokemon Battle game. I picked this type of style game because it seems to be basic to many other fighting games. Therefore, it would be fun to try to recreate a simpler version of it.

## GAME RULES ##

  * The player would be able to pick out what pokemon they wanted to use from the provided selection and from there they would be able to battle with an NPC. During the battle, there would be a set of four attacks where they can pick from. To win the game you would need to bring down the NPC health point to zero.
