# POKEMON BATTLE #

## OVERVIEW ##

  * In this project, I wanted to make a Pokemon Battle game. I picked this type of style game because it seems to be basic to many other fighting games. Therefore, it would be fun to try to recreate a simpler version of it.

## GAME RULES ##

  * The player would be able to pick out what pokemon they wanted to use from the provided selection and from there they would be able to battle with an NPC. During the battle, there would be a set of four attacks where they can pick from. To win the game you would need to bring down the NPC health point to zero.

## USERS STORIES ##

    * As soon as the user picked the pokemon of their choice. It would redirect the player to the battle arena. There the user would be able to choose from four different attacks that are listed for the pokemon of choice. As each round goes, the player needs to bring down the NPC health point to zero. That would be the only way to win the game. 

### MVP ###

    * Monday: I would try to do more research and have my thought process written down. 
    * Tuesday: I would get the Html done because I would like to have a structure built. Then start on my javascript. 
    * Wednesday: I should be working on my javascript. There I would try to "go live". Make sure everything is working accordingly. 
    * Thursday: I should finish up the javascript and start working on my CSS. 
    * Friday: Ready to deploy

### Strech Goals ### 

    * Add some api in there, such as information about each pokemon that is provided.
